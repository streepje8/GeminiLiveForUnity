## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Acquire an API Key**
   Visit [https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys) and aquire a **Gemini API key**.

2. **Add the Package to Unity**

   * Open your Unity project.
   * Go to **Window → Package Manager**.
   * Click the **‘+’** button in the top-left corner and select **“Add package from Git URL…”**
   * Enter the following URL:

     ```
     https://github.com/streepje8/GeminiLiveForUnity.git
     ```
   * Click **Add** and wait for Unity to import and compile the package.

3. **Try the Sample Scene**

   * Open the **Sample Scene** provided with the package.
   * Select the **Gemini GameObject** in the scene.
   * Paste your **API Key** into the Gemini component’s field.
   * Run the scene to test text and audio outputs.

## 🧠 Samples

The package includes a **Script Usage Sample** demonstrating how to interact with the Gemini Live API from code.
Use it as a foundation for your own integrations or prototypes. To get started, locate the Gemini object in the sample scene and paste in your API key.

## 🧩 Session Events

The Gemini Live for Unity integration provides several session-related events that allow you to track the state and activity of a Gemini session in real time.

| **Event Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `GeminiSessionStartEvent` | Triggered when a new Gemini session is **started**. |
| `GeminiSessionReadyEvent` | Triggered when the Gemini session is **ready to receive prompts**. |
| `GeminiSessionEndEvent` | Triggered when the Gemini session has **ended**. |
| `GeminiSessionInteractionEvent` | Triggered when **Gemini generates an interaction or response** during the session. |
| `GeminiPromptedEvent` | Triggered when a **user sends input or a prompt** to Gemini. |
| `GeminiTranscribeEvent` | Triggered when a **transcription** (by Gemini) is received. |
| `GeminiServerClosedSessionEvent` | Triggered when **Gemini’s server closes the session** — exceptions are thrown instead if this happens due to a client error. |
| `GeminiJsonPacketReceived` | Triggered when **raw JSON data** is received from the Gemini WebSocket. |
| `GeminiGenerationCompleteEvent` | Triggered when Gemini finishes generating its response. |
| `GeminiTurnEndEvent` | Triggered when Gemini finishes speaking. |
| `GeminiReceiveUsageMetricsEvent` | Triggered when Usage Metrics are Received from Google. (Token usage for last prompt) |
| `GeminiLiveEvent` | A **catch-all event** that fires for *any* Gemini-related event in the session. |

> 💡 Use these events via `Session.AddListener<>()` and `Session.RemoveListener<>()` to hook your own scripts up to the gemini session.
