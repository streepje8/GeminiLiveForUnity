## 🧩 Session Events

The Gemini Live for Unity integration provides several session-related events that allow you to track the state and activity of a Gemini session in real time.

| **Event Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `GeminiSessionStartEvent` | Triggered when a new Gemini session is **started**. |
| `GeminiSessionReadyEvent` | Triggered when the Gemini session is **ready to receive prompts**. |
| `GeminiSessionEndEvent` | Triggered when the Gemini session has **ended**. |
| `GeminiSessionInteractionEvent` | Triggered when **Gemini generates an interaction or response** during the session. |
| `GeminiPromptedEvent` | Triggered when a **user sends input or a prompt** to Gemini. |
| `GeminiTranscribeEvent` | Triggered when a **transcription** (by Gemini) is received. |
| `GeminiServerClosedSessionEvent` | Triggered when **Gemini’s server closes the session** — exceptions are thrown instead if this happens due to a client error. |
| `GeminiJsonPacketReceived` | Triggered when **raw JSON data** is received from the Gemini WebSocket. |
| `GeminiLiveEvent` | A **catch-all event** that fires for *any* Gemini-related event in the session. |

> 💡 Use these events to hook your own scripts up to the gemini session.
